The software desing pattern chosen for this project has been MVVM, since Apple has been enhancing this pattern in the last few years. I have decided to go for SwiftUI and Combine because it is funnier and of course the future. And it has been great! I enjoyed it and I am willing to learn more about it (despite the fact that code can be widely improved since I am new to this technology 😅)
